# How to Use PSA Interface Checker to Update Your Lexia Interface
 
If you have a Lexia interface for diagnosing PSA Group vehicles (Peugeot, Citroen, etc.), you may need to update its firmware to make it compatible with the latest version of Diagbox software. Diagbox is the official diagnostic software for PSA Group, which includes both Lexia and PP2000 applications.
